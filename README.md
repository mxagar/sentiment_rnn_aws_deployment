# Sentiment Analysis RNN Deployed Using AWS SageMaker

This repository contains a Sentiment Analysis Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units which is deployed using [AWS SageMaker].

The project is implemented with [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and it uses materials from the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101), which can be obtained in their original (non-implemented) form in [sagemaker-deployment](https://github.com/mxagar/sagemaker-deployment).
